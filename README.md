# N-Queens-Problem-Python

Developed a program to solve the N Queens problem by using the constraint satisfaction approach. This minimum conflict heuristic enables the program to constantly find the number of conflicts each queen is running into. Then it takes the location of the queen with the most conflicts in addition to the other queens, and attempts to locate another position for the queen with the most conflicts where she will have less to no conflicts. This is done until all the queens face no conflicts. Open the queens.py file and run it in the terminal using python/python3 queens.py. Then when asked, input N which will represent the N by N dimensions of the board in addition to the N number of queens placed on the board. The program will then solve the problem and output the final state in addition to how many moves was required.
